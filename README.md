# fitmetrics
fit.R measures how good, with respect to noise, a particular fit metric is, such as R-Squared or RMSE.  The point of the package is to compare one’s measure to the likelihood of noise giving that same conditions (i.e degrees of freedom).  R-Squared is often used for determining how well a set of points conforms to a line or model with a non-zero slope, even if the number of degrees of freedom is small.  This package shows that R-Squared, for instance, is very sensitive to noise at low degrees of freedom and provides the user with the baseline (or ceiling) that one’s measurements should stay above (below) in order to be sure they are not likely to have been effected by noise.
